MO's solutions for Advent of Code [2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) and [2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

These solutions prioritize using [NumPy](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) and speed above just about everything else. I am trying to be more **effective** and **efficient** in my programming skills.
